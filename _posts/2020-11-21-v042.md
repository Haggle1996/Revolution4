# The 'Stupid Things I Forgot!' Update, REVOLUTION|4 0.4.2 ALPHA

Some quick config fixes to the first-day release.

## Pack Changes

- Made it dark again at night.
- Turned off GeoStrata vents -- they were lagging everything
- Torches can now be relit by right clicking on them. No flint and steel needed. This fixed an issue where clicking on the torches with a GregTech flint and steel would crash the game.
