# The 'It's Been a Few Years!' Update, REVOLUTION|4 0.4.0 ALPHA

Hi all!

Welcome to the first publically-available release of REVOLUTION 4. It's been a few years since I've built a pack. I had a few ideas rambling around in my head for one more 1.7.10 pack. This time around, it's a GregTech-themed technology pack. I hope you have a good time as I plow forward in the development.

Please note, this is what I consider an "alpha" release, meaning it functions, but I may make some drastic world generation-changing decisions along the way. When releases are tagged with "beta", world-generation should be stable.

## Pack Changes

- Updated the starter kit to include fencing, walls, lighting, cannons, rock ammo, and some black granite rocks for starter tools.
- Rubber can be made again from Tree Resin in a furnace.
