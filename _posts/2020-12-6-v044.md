# The 'Let There Be Light' Update

Or more simply put, stop letting Haggle play with the light settings! The world now has a day cycle again, though nights are still dark and your dear, dear torches do go out. Zombies will actively attack your torches, so you'll need to find better ways to light your world (this is another plug for Electrical Age lighting).

## Pack Changes

- Restored the normal day/night cycle.
- Zombies will attack torches and other non-EA/Floodlights sources of light.

## Mods Added
